# Noise System Design: Trading Trends and Narratives

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a system design for Noise's programmatic liquidity platform that enables users to trade trends and narratives as assets. The design leverages architectural patterns from the qtrade system, adapting them to the unique requirements of discovering, quantifying, and trading global narratives as financial instruments.

At its core, the system combines real-time data indexing, sophisticated trend analysis, optimized routing, and reliable transaction execution to create a seamless platform for narrative-based trading.

## System Overview

The Noise platform transforms intangible market trends and narratives into tradable assets through a sophisticated system with five key components:

#### Key Components

1. **Event Processor**: Receives data from various sources and routes it to appropriate parsers based on data type and source
2. **Trend Parsers**: Specialized parsers for different data sources that extract relevant information:
   - `SocialMediaParser`: Processes Twitter, Reddit, and other social media posts
   - `NewsParser`: Extracts information from news articles
   - `MarketDataParser`: Processes financial market data
   - `WebContentParser`: Extracts relevant data from web content

3. **Event Handlers**: Convert parsed data into structured narrative and trend models and update the shared caches

4. **Thread-Safe Caches**: Provide concurrent, low-latency access to current narrative and trend states:
   - `NarrativeCache`: Maintains current active narratives and their key characteristics
   - `TrendCache`: Stores trend indicators including momentum and direction
   - `SentimentCache`: Houses sentiment metrics related to narratives

5. **Telemetry**: OpenTelemetry integration captures performance metrics throughout the pipeline to monitor health and efficiency

#### Data Flow

1. Raw data is collected from multiple sources (social media, news, market data, web content)
2. The Event Processor routes data to specialized parsers based on source and format
3. Parsers extract relevant information and structure it for further processing
4. Event Handlers update the shared caches with the latest narrative and trend data
5. The Router component has continuous access to up-to-date narrative and trend information
