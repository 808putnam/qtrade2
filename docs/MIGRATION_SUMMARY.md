# Migration Summary: `qtrade-runtime::relayer` to `qtrade-relayer`

## Overview
Successfully migrated the `qtrade_runtime::relayer::run_relayer()` functionality and all supporting code from `qtrade-runtime` to the new `qtrade-relayer` crate. This includes the RPC modules, metrics, and supporting utilities.

## Files Migrated

### Main Structure
- `lib.rs` - Core relayer functionality with the main `run_relayer()` function
- `constants.rs` - Constants for tracing and metrics
- `secrets.rs` - API keys for various RPC providers
- `rpc.rs` - Main RPC trait definition

### RPC Modules
- `rpc/solana.rs` - Solana RPC client implementation
- `rpc/helius.rs` - Helius RPC implementation
- `rpc/temporal.rs` - Temporal RPC implementation
- `rpc/quicknode.rs` - Quicknode RPC implementation
- `rpc/bloxroute.rs` - Bloxroute RPC implementation
- `rpc/nextblock.rs` - Nextblock RPC implementation
- `rpc/jito.rs` - Jito RPC implementation
- `rpc/triton.rs` - Triton RPC implementation

### Metrics
- `metrics/mod.rs` - Module definition for metrics
- `metrics/arbitrage.rs` - Metrics for arbitrage operations
- `metrics/database.rs` - Database-related metrics

## Fixes Implemented
1. Updated all dependencies to use workspace dependencies
2. Fixed the module structure to properly map imports between files
3. Updated base64 encoding usage to use the new Engine API pattern
4. Removed unused imports in `lib.rs`
5. Fixed a duplicate constant definition issue in `secrets.rs`
6. Ensured proper tracing names by using the new `QTRADE_RELAYER_TRACER_NAME` constant

## Changes to qtrade-runtime
1. Removed the original `relayer.rs` module
2. Removed the `rpc/` directory and all its contents
3. Removed `metrics/arbitrage.rs` and `metrics/database.rs`
4. Updated `qtrade-runtime/Cargo.toml` to include `qtrade-relayer` as a dependency
5. Updated code references in `qtrade-runtime/src/lib.rs` to use the migrated code from `qtrade-relayer`
6. Updated `router.rs` to initialize the arbitrage receiver from `qtrade-relayer`

## Current State
The migration is complete and all code in both crates (`qtrade-relayer` and `qtrade-runtime`) compiles successfully. All references to the relayer functionality now correctly point to the new `qtrade-relayer` crate.

## Potential Future Improvements
1. Address the circular dependency concern between `qtrade-relayer` and `qtrade-router`
2. Consider creating a shared types crate for `ArbitrageResult` and other shared data structures
3. Implement more robust error handling throughout the codebase
4. Add comprehensive tests for the new crate functionality
5. Clean up the warning messages from the Rust compiler in related crates
