//! This module provides simple wrappers for various Solana operations.
//! 
//! The operations include:
//! - Creating a mint
//! - Minting tokens
//! - Creating an associated token account (ATA)
//! - Starting a local validator
//! 
//! These wrappers simplify the interaction with the Solana blockchain by abstracting
//! the underlying complexities and providing easy-to-use functions.

use tracing::info;

/// Starts a local Solana validator for testing purposes.
/// 
/// This function initializes and starts a local Solana validator node,
/// which can be used for development and testing without interacting
/// with the main Solana network.
pub fn start_local_validator() {
    info!("Starting local validator...");
